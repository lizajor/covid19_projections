## Help support an unbiased, rigorous, data-driven approach to COVID-19

### **February 2021 Update:** Thank you for your interest in donating to my project. I am very grateful to have reached my fundraising goal - we raised $50k from over 600 donors! If you are still interested in donating, I kindly request that you consider a donation to your [local food bank](https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank), [GiveDirectly](https://www.givedirectly.org/), or [Stop Asian Hate](https://donate.givedirect.org/?cid=14711).

*covid19-projections.com* is entirely built and run by myself, [Youyang Gu](https://youyanggu.com). Since April, I have volunteered thousands of hours of my time to making sure that people have the best data and model possible to make informed decisions.

I didn't set up this page until December because I wanted to focus purely on the modeling. Having your support now would make my job much easier and allow me to continue focusing full-time on providing the best COVID-19 modeling and analysis.

I hope to continue to dedicate my efforts to this project for as long as possible, until [normality returns](/path-to-herd-immunity).

With your donation, I can:

- Continue to work on *covid19-projections.com* full-time
- Pay for dedicated hosting and computing
- Expand research efforts
- Increase reach
- Fight misinformation
- Inspire further action

*January 2021 Update:* For the purpose of full disclosure, I have also received a grant from [Emergent Ventures](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures) to support my COVID-19 modeling efforts.

## We do more with less

You can be confident that each dollar donated will be used in the most efficient way possible.

With my sincerest gratitude,
